# HawkinsOps Static Site (v3)

This build is intentionally **static-first**:
- HTML renders real numbers and content (no JS counters that show `0` to crawlers).
- JS only enhances UX (expandable modals, copy buttons, mobile menu).

## Deploy
Upload **everything** in this folder to your site root:
- `index.html` + all `*.html` pages
- `assets/` (CSS/JS/PDF)

If you only upload `index.html`, the resume PDF and styling will 404 (because hosting platforms love chaos).

## Hosting strategy
- Primary production hosting: **Cloudflare Pages**
- Publish directory: `site/`

## Update counts
Counts are sourced from your repo releases / verification artifacts:
- `raylee-hawkins/HawkinsOperations`
- Local verification script: `scripts/verify/verify-counts.ps1`

When counts change, regenerate verified artifacts from source of truth:
- `python scripts/generate_verified_counts.py`
- `python scripts/drift_scan.py --refresh`
