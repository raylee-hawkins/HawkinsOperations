## THIS REPO IS PUBLIC

Everything committed here is visible to recruiters and the world.
Treat every file as if a hiring manager will read it.

## Project identity

- Purpose: evidence-first SOC portfolio for job hunting
- Target roles: Primary SOC Analyst (T1/T2); Secondary junior detection + automation
- Clearance line (use verbatim everywhere): "Eligible to obtain clearance; willing to pursue sponsorship."

## MANDATORY BEFORE EVERY COMMIT

1. Run: .\scripts\verify-counts.ps1
2. Run: python .\scripts\drift_scan.py
3. Confirm no real IPs, credentials, or hostnames in the diff
4. Confirm .gitignore covers Evidence-Raw/ and .obsidian/
5. Get Raylee approval — never push without confirmation

## COMMIT FORMAT

Add: what you added
Update: what changed and why
Fix: what was broken, what you did
Docs: documentation-only changes
Refactor: structural change, no behavior change

## NUMBERS

Source of truth: PROOF_PACK/VERIFIED_COUNTS.md
Never hardcode counts in site/ or content/ — always reference VERIFIED_COUNTS.md.
Run verify-counts.ps1 any time a detection rule or playbook is added or removed.

## Environment constraints

- Windows 11 + Linux Mint dual-boot
- When giving commands:
  - Prefer PowerShell (`pwsh`) for verification scripts and Windows workflows
  - Use fish-compatible syntax on Linux (avoid bashisms)
- Always use `MM-DD-YYYY` date format in filenames, logs, and documentation.
- Deployment primary: Cloudflare Pages (production)
- Site publish directory is `site/` (static HTML/CSS/JS, no framework)

## Files you must not break

- `PROOF_PACK/VERIFIED_COUNTS.md`
- `START_HERE.md`
- `README.md`
- `site/index.html`
- `scripts/verify/verify-counts.ps1`

## Hosting guardrails

- Cloudflare Pages is the production host.
- Cloudflare project must publish from `site/` and track `main` for production.
- `site/_redirects` supports pretty URLs (`/security -> /security.html`, etc.)
- `site/_headers` exists (security headers)
- `site/404.html` exists (custom 404)
- Resume PDF must exist at: `site/assets/Raylee_Hawkins_Resume.pdf`
- Resume link must be: `/assets/Raylee_Hawkins_Resume.pdf` (absolute path)

## Standard workflow (no vibes)

1. Check repo state first (`git status`, recent commits/PR context if relevant)
2. Make smallest change that satisfies the requested phase
3. Run verification + local test before calling it "done"
4. Keep diffs small; do not add dependencies unless explicitly requested
5. Never print or commit secrets/tokens

## Verification / local test

- Verify counts: `pwsh -File scripts/verify/verify-counts.ps1`
- Serve site locally: `python -m http.server --directory site 8000`
- Minimum click-test paths: `/`, `/security`, `/projects`, `/resume` (PDF download), `/proof`, `/lab`, `/triage`
